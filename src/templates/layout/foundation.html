                <p>library Pattern Library or VPL, is a CSS Framework is meant to allow for easier, more standard compliant web design using Cascading Style Sheet. It help in a more scalable and maintainable approach to UI development.</p>
                <p>This is a UI Starter Kit which holds guardrails and best practices for UI development within MyCompany UI projects. <br /> This is geared to use as a CSS Framework and JavaScript is kept open based on various developmental needs</p>
                <p>No matter what developmental framework environment one follows in the basic foundation UI is always remains the same. And a good healthy HTML and CSS framework is of essential importance to have a scalable and maintainable development. <br /> Development team can plugin other open source frameworks such as, bootstrap, angular etc within this VPL framwork as an extension for their developmental needs. As this will help in producing a Client Customized Pattern Library as a Library of UI assets/components for a healthy UI development process. <br /> Some features to note</p>
                <ul class="libraryuidocs-list-styled">
                	<li>Unlike other online UI libraries which uses more generic CSS naming convention, and a stripped down version of external library. Our Kit can be customized easily with client specific CSS name spaces, e.g. AIGUI, NYLUI, and so on.(currently named as classnameui)
					</li>
					<li>name spaced CSS naming convention classes will help you distinguish your CSS class names from other project and helps scalability and maintainability
					</li>
					<li>uses a SASS compiler, a better way to organize and distribute CSS for maintainability and better coding and throws build errors if CSS are not written properly, part of the build process
					</li>
					<li>uses SASS precompilers within the framework, so no need to write browser based classes as it autogenerates in the build process. e.g. -moz- or -webkit-
					</li>
					<li>enforces right way of organizing media-queries, so that it can be maintained in a much scalable manner
					</li>
					<li>it has a bootstrap grid class naming convention, which can be switched between 'float' based layouts to 'flex' based system with a change of one single variable.</li>
					<li>a robust build process</li>
					<li>organized folder structure to guide prepare HTML and CSS codes, this is a very important guide to organize UI structure within the project
					</li>
					<li>A  special **external.css is built part of the library which will help you organize external CSS library classes used by project and keeps distinguishing from the main ‘projectui-classes' for better maintainability
					</li>
					<li>since flex used we are targeting more modern browsers, latest versions on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and for IE edge, IE11
					</li>
                </ul>

                <p>library UI uses Grunt build process and has SASS compilers with auto pre-fixer for CSS compilation. So we don't need to write the different browser pre-fixer.</p>

            <div>
                <p>We have used Bootstrap Grid system within the library UI layout so that all projects we build will be mobile friendly from the start. Instead of adding on optional mobile styles, they're baked right into the core. In fact, Bootstrap is mobile first. Mobile first styles can be found throughout the entire library instead of in separate files</p>
                <p>To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the viewport meta tag to your HTML head tag.</p>
